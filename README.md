# PHP TestFest

The TestFest is an event that aims at improving the
[code coverage](http://gcov.php.net/) of the test suite for the PHP language
itself. As part of this event, local User Groups (UG) are invited to join the
TestFest. These UGs can meet physically or come together virtually. The point
however is that people network to learn together. Aside from being an
opportunity for all of you to make friends with like minded people in your
(virtual) community, it also will hopefully reduce the work load for the
PHP.net mentors. All it takes is someone to organize a UG to spearhead the
event and to get others involved in
[writing phpt tests](http://qa.php.net/write-test.php). The submissions will
then be reviewed by members of php.net before getting included in the official
test suite.
